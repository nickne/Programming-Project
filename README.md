# Programming-Project
Stack calculator

This program gets data from Quandl and then uses it for its calculations.
It calculates the Value at Risk (VaR) for a chosen stock, the value a one dollar investment would have at the enddate of the timeframe
if shares of the stock would have been bought at the startdate of the timeframe.
Further it shows different plots of metrics from the stock. Such as the development of the adjusted closing price, 
the volatility of the stock, the distribution of the daily returns and a graph with adjustable moving averages, 
which can be used for decision making on whether to buy or sell the stock.
